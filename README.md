# Smoothie8266
Firmware for the ESP8266 to mimic the Smoothieware webserver when connected to a smoothieware-running controller over serial.

This is a basic proof of concept. Serving data stored in esp flash seems fast enough.
Wifi autoconfig works well.

#TODO:
- Port to esphttd
- read config data from smoothie sd card
- read file support
